# go-concurrency-limits

A Go implementation of the [Netflix/concurrency-limits](https://github.com/Netflix/concurrency-limits) library.

## Overview

This project is a Go language port of Netflix's concurrency-limits library, designed to bring their adaptive concurrency limits algorithms to Go applications. The original Netflix implementation is written in Java, and this port aims to provide the same functionality with idiomatic Go code.

## Motivation

Netflix's concurrency-limits library provides an elegant solution for preventing service overload through adaptive limiting strategies. This Go port enables Go developers to leverage the same battle-tested algorithms for:

- Preventing service overload
- Maintaining high throughput and low latency under load
- Dynamically adjusting concurrency limits based on real-time performance
